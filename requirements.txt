torch>=2.0
torchvision>=0.15
cupy-cuda12x>=12.0  # Match your CUDA version (e.g., cupy-cuda11x or cupy-cuda12x)
nvtx>=0.2
matplotlib>=3.7     # Optional, if you visualize anything

ðŸ§  Notes:
Use cupy-cuda12x or cupy-cuda11x depending on your installed CUDA toolkit.

If you used GradScaler and autocast, those are part of torch.ampâ€”no extra install needed.

If you want to lock exact versions for reproducibility, you can freeze with:
pip freeze > requirements.txt
